        //   expressive rather than using size(). it is faster, in some cases by orders of magnitude.
        //   all of these implement the “size” method by iterating trough the collection and because of this,
        //   calling size gets increasingly slower as the number of elements increase
        
        
        //5. A for loop is use to execute a block of codes and it will end until if the condition will turn to
        //   false and it is a repeatition sontrol structure that allows you to write a loop that needs to be executed.
        //  . Pros, it is use for iteration, useful when you know how many times a task is to be repeated.
        //  for each loop is also known as enhanced for loop the same as another loop is also allows us to
        //  traverse an arrays. Pros, programming error is limited, it makes the code more readable and easy
        //  to understand, no usage of counters. Cons, you cannot skip any element, you cannot traverse to odd and
        //  even indexes, you cannot traverse the elements in reversed way.
